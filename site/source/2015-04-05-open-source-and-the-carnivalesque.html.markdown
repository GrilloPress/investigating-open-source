# Open Source and the Carnivalesque

In this article I will explore Mikhail Baktin's (sp) theory of the Carnivalesque in relationship to the concept of Open Source and in paritcular  JavaScript and the modern development of JavaScript

## What is the "Carnivalesque"?

## How might that help us understand open source culture/behaviour/philosophy?

## Space to be "different"

## Difference and branching

## Merging and returning to order

## The right tone and attitude (to forking)

"It is a type of performance, but this performance is communal, with no boundary between performers and audience. It creates a situation in which diverse voices are heard and interact, breaking down conventions and enabling genuine dialogue. It creates the chance for a new perspective and a new order of things, by showing the relative nature of all that exists"

The carnivalesque "replaces the false unity of the dominant system"

## changes to the micro level

moments you let the set order or people with power be distrupted


## When the space to be "different" is appropriated for material reasons
